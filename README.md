# Simple Grunt Test

This is a really simple project for beginner's to learn about using Grunt. This project is **not** tasked with creating jQuery and Grunt plugins.

## Getting Started

To get started with it, clone the repository. If you don't have Grunt installed, then run the following steps:

    npm install -g grunt
    npm install -g grunt-init
 
 These will install grunt and grunt-init globally, which will allow you to initialise the project. Afterwards, grab a copy of the basic gruntfile initialiser. You can do this as follows:
 
    git clone git@github.com:gruntjs/grunt-init-gruntfile.git ~/.grunt-init/gruntfile

 Finally, with everything in place, initialise the project, based on the Gruntfile by running:

    npm install

## Documentation

The reason that this project was created, is two fold. Firstly, it's to support an upcoming article about learning Grunt and then it's to help both myself and others, as first timers to Grunt, get up and running with it quicker than might otherwise be expected. 

Don't get me wrong, after spending a good number of hours working with Grunt, I can really see the benefits in using it. But a lot of the documentation and tutorials that I found online are misleading as they're referencing earlier versions of Grunt which now seem to no longer work as indicated. 

Secondly, they're for writing jQuery and Grunt plugins. This project is for working with existing JavaScript-based projects and using Grunt as the build tool to help ensure project quality and simplify the release process. So, with that in mind, it doesn't get fancy. It just does the basics.
